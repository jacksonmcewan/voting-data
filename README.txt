Hello and welcome to my project! In this Colab notebook you will find code and brief documentation that assesses the relationship between various indicators across states and their voting data, as well as models that predict voting habits.

The goal is to put together several data sources, visualizations, and machine learning models in order to predict the relationships among explanatory variables, and use these variables and models to make predictions about individual voting habits.
